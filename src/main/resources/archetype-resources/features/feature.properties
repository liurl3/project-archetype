          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

      the conditions stated in this License.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
